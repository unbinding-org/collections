  quotes:
    - a community of practitioners, in which generation after generation has been trained in an apprenticeship.
    - certain fundamental truths are true regardless of time or culture
    - there is a way to genuine, unconditioned happiness
    - everything you experience is fabricated

    - release is the essence of the Dhamma
    - You don’t start out by defining what you are. You start out by looking at how you shape your experience. You then see that there is a way of shaping your experience so it will lead you to the threshold of something that’s not shaped.
    - all the things that you could possibly identify with are not worth identifying with

  title: The Karma of Questions
  author: Thanissaro Bhikkhu
  url: http://www.dhammatalks.org/Archive/Writings/KarmaOfQuestions160712.pdf
  quotes:
    - four sorts of questions - those deserving a straight answer, those that need their terms redefined, those deserving a counter-question in response, and those that should be put aside.
    - suffering leads to two reactions - bewilderment (“Why is this happening to me?”) and search (“Is there anyone who knows how to put an end to this pain?”).
    - a deeper happiness that comes from within
    - a human being’s potential for finding true happiness
    - stand still and face up to it, [...] examine it carefully
    - respect is basic to any ability to learn
    - In their eyes, the religious attitude of respect is needed for any philosophical understanding to grow
    - Respect is the attitude you develop toward the things that matter in life.
    - If you see true happiness as possible, and its causes as precarious, contingent, and dependent on your attitude, you’ll naturally show them the care and respect needed to keep them healthy and strong.
    - each moment is composed of three things - results from past actions, present actions, and the immediate results of present actions
    - intention [is] [...] the essence of action
    - when you show respect for those who have mastered the path, you’re also showing respect for qualities you want to develop in yourself.
    - when the mind is opened to what truly deserves respect, all things noble and good can come in.

  title: Knowing through the body
  author: Joel W. Krueger
  url: http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~kangchan/readings/Laozi/Krueger_2009.pdf
  quotes:
    - a form of nonrepresentational action
    - the epistemic priority of practical over propositional knowledge
    - a consideration of moral action
    - moral excellence is not simply equivalent to the accumulation of moral principles or reasons. Beyond this, it involves in no small measure the cultivation of various bodily, perceptual, and attentional skills that enable us to enact our moral excellence spontaneously and appropriately, very often without the intervention of principled reasoning
    - abstract conceptions of the self that overemphasize our cognitive relations with the world rob our self-model of the rich affective ethos that emerges through the spontaneity of a creative life -- a life that transforms and is transformed by the situations and world of which it is an active part
    - they exhibit a situational appropriateness that differentiates them from simple instinct.
