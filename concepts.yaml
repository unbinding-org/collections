    there is merit in generosity
    that the moral qualities of good and bad are inherent in the universe, and not simply social conventions;
    that there is life after death;
    one has a true moral debt to one's parents;
    that there are people who have lived the renunciate's life properly in such a way that they have gained true and direct knowledge of these matters.
